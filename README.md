# IntelliJ IDEA Legacy Find in Files Logic Plugin

<!-- Plugin description -->
<p>This plugin adds new action (Find in Files Using Legacy Logic) on top of context menu for selected text for editor and diff.</p>
<p>This logic was changed in <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-212529">this</a> task
and for me personally the old one was more suitable to find code blocks because usually code block have different trailing spaces.</p>
